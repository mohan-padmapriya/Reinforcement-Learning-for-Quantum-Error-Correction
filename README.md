# Reinforcement-Learning-for-Quantum-Error-Correction
As part of my internship with CQuICC at IIT Madras, with Prof Prabha Mandayam, Prof nicolas Gheeraert, and Prof Siddharth Dhomkar

This repository explores the use of reinfocement learning in quantum error correction, particularly to find good quantum error correcting codes.
